It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions.

The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $1,212 and $1,068 at the end of 2024 and 2023.

The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis.

The carrying value of the Company’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term nature or variable interest rates. See Notes 2, 3, and 4 for the carrying value and fair value of the Company’s investments, derivative instruments, and fixed-rate debt.Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is estimated by applying a fair value hierarchy, which requires maximizing the use of observable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs are:Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by marketdata.Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money market mutual funds, which are included in cash and cash equivalents, are based on quoted market prices, such as quoted net asset values published by the fund as supported in an active market. Valuation methodologies used to measure the fair value of all other non-derivative financial instruments are based on independent external valuation information. The pricing process uses data from a variety of independent external valuation information providers, including trades, bid price or spread, two-sided markets, quotes, benchmark curves including but not limited to treasury benchmarks, Secured Overnight Financing Rate and swap curves, discount rates, and market data feeds. All are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. The Company reports transfers in and out of Levels 1, 2, and 3, as applicable, using the fair value of the individual securities as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the transfer(s) occurred.Current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Long-term financial liabilities include the Company's long-term debt, which are recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price and adjusted for unamortized discounts or premiums and debt issuance costs. Discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense over the term of the loan. The estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt is based primarily on reported market values, recently completed market transactions, and estimates based upon interest rates, maturities, and credit.."

At August 31, 2025, Costco operated 914 warehouses worldwide: 629 in the United States (U.S.) located in 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 110 in Canada, 42 in Mexico, 37 in Japan, 29 in the U.K., 20 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, two in Sweden, and one each in Iceland and New Zealand. The Company operated e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia.Basis of PresentationThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Costco and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material inter-company transactions among the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries have been eliminated in consolidation.Fiscal Year EndThe Company operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year basis with the year ending on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2025 and 2024 relate to the 52-week fiscal years ended August 31, 2025, and September 1, 2024. References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.ReclassificationReclassifications were made to the 2024 consolidated balance sheet to conform with current year presentation.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receivables were $2,670 and $2,519 at the end of 2025 and 2024.Short-Term InvestmentsShort-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. government and agency securities), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.."

References to 2023 relate to the 53-week fiscal year ended September 3, 2023.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions take into account historical and forward-looking factors that the Company believes are reasonable. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.ReclassificationReclassifications were made to the 2024 consolidated balance sheet to conform with current year presentation.Cash and Cash EquivalentsThe Company considers as cash and cash equivalents all cash on deposit, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, and proceeds due from credit and debit card transactions with settlement terms of up to four days. Credit and debit card receivables were $2,670 and $2,519 at the end of 2025 and 2024.Short-Term InvestmentsShort-term investments generally consist of debt securities (U.S. government and agency securities), with maturities at the date of purchase of three months to five years. Investments with maturities beyond five years may be classified, based on the Company’s determination, as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because they represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.."

At August 31, 2025, Costco operated 914 warehouses worldwide: 629 in the United States (U.S.) located in 47 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, 110 in Canada, 42 in Mexico, 37 in Japan, 29 in the U.K., 20 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, seven in China, five in Spain, two in France, two in Sweden, and one each in Iceland and New Zealand.

It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign-exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency. The contracts relate primarily to U.S. dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by the Company’s international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts either do not qualify for or the Company has not elected derivative hedge accounting. The Company seeks to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and does not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative instruments in a net liability position and the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered were immaterial at the end of 2025 and 2024. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were $1,184 and $1,212 at the end of 2025 and 2024. See Note 3 for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2025 and 2024.The unrealized gains or losses recognized in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2025, 2024 and 2023.The Company is exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada. The Company also enters into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of natural gas, in addition to fuel for its gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the “normal purchases and normal sales” exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.."
