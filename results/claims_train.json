Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the 2006 ESPP.During 2022, 70 million RSUs and stock options, as calculated on a weighted average basis for the year, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the table above because they would have been anti-dilutive. These RSUs and options could potentially be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation in the future if the average market value of the common shares increases above the exercise price. For all other periods presented, securities that would have been anti-dilutive were insignificant and have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share."

Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock. From time to time, the Company's Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs for the repurchase of Class B Common Stock. The value of repurchased shares is deducted from Total shareholders' equity through allocation to Capital in excess of stated value and Retained earnings.STOCK-BASED COMPENSATIONThe NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the \"Stock Incentive Plan\") provides for the issuance of up to 798 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock awards, including restricted stock and restricted stock units. Restricted stock units include both time-vesting restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") as well as performance-based restricted stock units (\"PSUs\"). A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan and has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. The Company generally grants stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units on an annual basis. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Substantially all awards under the Stock Incentive Plan vest ratably over 4 years of continued employment, with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant. The following table summarizes the Company's total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable:  YEAR ENDED MAY 31,(Dollars in millions)202420232022Stock options(1)$336 $311 $297 ESPPs69 72 60 Restricted stock and restricted stock units(1)(2)399 372 281 TOTAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE$804 $755 $638 (1)Expense for stock options includes the expense associated with stock appreciation rights. (2)For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, expense for restricted stock units includes an immaterial amount of expense for PSUs.The income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $35 million, $71 million and $327 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and reported within Income tax expense.STOCK OPTIONSThe weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, computed as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $32.78, $31.31 and $37.53, respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values were as follows: YEAR ENDED MAY 31,202420232022Dividend yield1.2 %0.9 %0.8 %Expected volatility29.3 %27.1 %24.9 %Weighted average expected life (in years)5.85.85.8Risk-free interest rate4.3 %3.3 %0.9 %Expected volatilities are based on an analysis of the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, the implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock with a term greater than one year, as well as other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options."
